## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
In the current geopolitical climate, there are people in situations where it is unsafe to speak up about issues such as corruption, oppression, and social injustice. We hoped to create a place that provided enough protection so anyone can feel comfortable sharing their stories.

## ðŸ“œ What it does
> Bowlo is a decentralized platform created to allow anyone to engage in open, global conversation. Since data is peer to peer, Bowlo provides increased privacy and protection for users sharing stories or opinions which others may seek to suppress on social media sites.
